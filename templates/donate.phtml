    <h3 class="infoHeader">Why would I donate?</h3>

    <p>
        Tregmine is run entirely on a volonteer basis. Nobody makes any money of Tregmine, and server
        costs are funded out of our own pockets. If you want to help us to keep the server running,
        you are welcome to make a donation.
    </p>
