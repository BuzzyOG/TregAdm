        <h4>New Homepage <small>February 18, 2014</small></h4>
        <p>
            We've had a basic website in addition to our forum for a while, but as many has pointed out, it suffered from certain issues.
            Today it is our pleasure to unveil a completely revamped website, which constitute a significant leap forward in terms of
            both looks and usability. While a lot of work still remains, we're confident that it'll contribute to making Tregmine
            a much better experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            As always, we welcome feedback - positive as well as constructively negative.

        <h4>Tregmine is back after latest attack. <small>9th September, 2013</small></h4>
        <p>Tregmine is back after a prolonged service disruption
        caused by a DDOS attack. We have taken steps to safeguard
        ourselves from similiar efforts, by deploying a DDOS
        defense service. While we're not yet sure if it'll prove
        effective, we hope that it'll make us more resilient.</p>
        <p>We do not know who perpetrated this attack, or for what
        reason. DDOS's are by definition hard to trace, and even
        though we'll make an effort, the likelihood of actually
        tracking someone is low.</p>

        <h4>Plugins are now open source <small>1st July, 2013</small></h4>
        <p>Although it has been in the works for many years, it's
        finally done: The Tregmine plugins are open source, and
        available <a href="http://github.com/EmilHernvall/tregmine">on github</a>.</p>
        <p>Contributions are welcome!</p>
