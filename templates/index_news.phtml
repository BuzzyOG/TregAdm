    <h3>Tregmine is back after latest attack</h3>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">9th September, 2013</p>

    <p>
        Tregmine is back after a prolonged service disruption
        caused by a DDOS attack. We have taken steps to safeguard
        ourselves from similiar efforts, by deploying a DDOS
        defense service. While we're not yet sure if it'll prove
        effective, we hope that it'll make us more resilient.
    </p>

    <p>
        We do not know who perpetrated this attack, or for what
        reason. DDOS's are by definition hard to trace, and even
        though we'll make an effort, the likelihood of actually
        tracking someone is low.

    <h3>New homepage</h3>

    <p>
        For the first time, we actually have a homepage, beyond
        the forums. It's integrated directly with minecraft, and
        will serve as an information source and tool for players
        and staff. All of our players can login to this page by
        setting a password within minecraft using the /password
        command. This is currently the only way to get access.
    </p>

    <h3>Plugins are now open source</h3>

    <p>
        Although it has been in the works for many years, it's
        finally done: The Tregmine plugins are open source, and
        available <a href="http://github.com/EmilHernvall/tregmine">on github</a>.
